CRM Listener Azure SharePoint Cloud Service
=============

This solution was presented at [SharePoint Evolution 2015](http://www.sharepointevolution.com) demonstrating the [Azure Service Bus](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/service-bus/) being used to connect up systems including Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2015 Online, SharePoint 2013 Online (this project) and Yammer.

Points of note:

0. The Cloud Service project will run as a console application in Azure - this could run anywhere, but will need to be configured to match the Service Definition (ServiceDefinition.csdef), by adding a minimum of two files; typically ServiceConfiguration.Local.cscfg and ServiceConfiguration.Cloud.cscfg
0. The code is "demo code"; no warranties implied etc.
